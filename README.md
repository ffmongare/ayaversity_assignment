# Sample Test Smart Contract Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Lock Smart Contract to lock funds for a certain period of time. It has a Test.sol smart contract, a test.js for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
